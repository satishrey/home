      <h2> Why Compare Them? </h2>
      <p> Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are some of the biggest and most talked about athletes in the sports industry. The clubs that they play for have one of the biggest rivalries in the sports industry as well.

         which may be true, but both players would definitely prefer to outshine the other.
